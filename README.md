# Poker Rule Induction
#### The goal of the project is automatic rules induction, i.e. to learn the rules using machine learning, without hand-coding heuristics.

#### Pretend you are in a foreign land, have never played the game before, are given a history of thousands of games, and are asked to come up with the rules. It is potentially difficult to discover rules that can correctly classify poker hands, yet it is trivial for a human to validate the rules objectively. The algorithm will need to find rules that are general enough to be broadly useful, without being so broad that they end up being occasionally wrong.
